<!-- ServoTest
     This is used to test javascript touch elements for controlling
     motors.
     J. King 31 Oct 2024

     To run this as the front end to the ESP32 ServoTest visit:
     https://madnordski.github.io/WebBLE-Apps/ServoTest.html
     
     This project is being used to help develop the interface for a
     project that might use servos, dc motors, stepping motors or a
     combination of these.  While we await arrival of the hardware we
     need to conduct our physical experiments, we can make progress by
     tinkering with the user interface.

     WebBLE reference:
         https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/bluetooth

     We will use an ESP32-C3 to control the motors. Preliminarily an
     XIAO ESP32-C3 is being used.  The communication between the
     android interface and the ESP32-C3 will be Bluetooth Low Energy
     (BLE).  On the phone we will use WebBLE.  This file represents
     the implementation of the WebBLE interface which runs on Android
     using a Web Browser.

     NB: The WebBLE security model requires that thiis script run over
     https, which we accomplish by launching it from our GITHUB
     page. Alternatively, (according to documentation) it can be
     loaded from the phone it runs on.  However, editing and debuging
     javascript on a phone is very limited.  Using a browser on our
     desktop computer allows the use the full javascript debugger in
     Chrome.

     For the most part, we call BLE Characteristics, Aspects because it
     is easier to type.

To connect the Android phone to Chrome running on our desktop:

1. Connect the phone to the computer over USB.

2. Under developer options on the phone enable USB debuging.

3. If USB debugging is already enabled, disable it, pause and enable
   it again before proceeding. If you don't have developer options,
   google how to enable them.

4. Now open the browser on the computer to chrome://inspect/#devices
   (it can take 4 minutes or more before a connection opens that shows
   the web pages open on the phone with a link to inspect - seriously,
   make tea)

5. While waiting for the phone to show up, a list of targets will
   appear. Just leave it alone, eventually your phone will show up
   in this list with an inspect link for the web page you want to debug.

6. Also while waiting, on the phone load the web page you want to
   debug on your browser.  In this case, it is
   https://madnordski.github.io/WebBLE-Apps/ServoTest.html. (https is
   required, which is why we run using the github file)

7. Eventually (5-10 minutes?), a link to INSPECT the web page you're
   debugging will appear in your computer browser.  Click the inspect
   link.  You did leave this page and your phone alone this entire
   time?

8. Once this is established, try not do anything that will crash or
   close the browser because when that happens you'll need to go back
   to step 1.  WebBLE will crash the browser window if reloaded while
   connected.

9. You can now reload and debug the app running on the phone as if
   it was running in your computers browser.

     Parts of this code was based on the work of Rui Santos.

   This script expands on the RNT example as follows:

   **1** It handles the loss of BLE connections by reseting.

   **2** It uses touch events to move servo motors.

   **3** It implements a queue for touch events.

  2. This web page loaded in a Chrome or Chromium browser.
  3. Typically, the Chrome browser will be running on an Android phone
  for convenient use. NB: a touch screen is required and the iPhone is
  not supported.
  4. The web page must be loaded over https (not just http). The
  easiest way for us regular folks to do this is by hosting it on a GIT
  hub page.  See Web Hosting options at pages.github.com.

  At the end of day, this function will tell us if all of these

   procedure is handled by the navigator.bluetooth subsystem. The user
   selects from a list of nodes but we limit the nodes to the one
   specified in deviceName. It would be nicer if we could just

/* writeOnControl

 Send commands and out-of-band control messages to the ESP32 and
 servos.

 The control aspect is separate from the Servo aspect because the
 touch interface will queue up a lot of requests for movement and it
 can take time for the queue to clear. We therefore need an
 "out-of-band" method for stopping the servos.  The writeOnControl
 function used here provides this as well as other control functions
 such as disconnect by reset (**1**).

 Control String  Purpose
 --------------  -------------------------------
    DIE       This restarts the server. We do this when we disconnect
              to ensure the next connection starts fresh. We
              discovered there are situations when the onDisconnect
	      callback cannot be relied upon.
    ACK       This is used to acknowledge the client recieved our status
              update.  We use this as proof of life for the client. If
	      the client shutdown, we want to restart so that we can
	      accept a new connection.
    STOP      Stop the servos. Using a separate characteristic for STOP
              and START insures these commands don't get lost in the
	      stream of move commands the client sends when a finger is
	      moving on the touch screen.
    START     Prepare for movement. Sent when the touch screen if first
              touched.
    SPEED a s Sets the servo speed.  For example, "SPEED 0 6" sets the X
              axis to speed zero and "SPEED 1 9" sets the Y servo to 9.
              The speed setting is 0 to 10 with 0 for slowest, 10 for fastest.

/* writeOnServo

   The servoAspect tells the ESP32 to move the motors and the
   direction of movement. We expect this function to produce failures
   because the BLE write queue is easily filled and touch events are
   quickly generated in large numbers.  Therefore, we implemented a
   queue for the messages.  When this function fails, the failed
   message stays at the front the queue so it will be tried again.
   The function processServoQueue() is responsible for emptying the
   queue.  NB: it's possible we would be more responsive to STOP if we
   don't retry move messages.  We would, of course, miss some
   movements.

   When we get a stop, we could drain the queue but in that case a
   mutex would be probably wise if not essential.

   The format of our messages is dX<space>dY. dX is the direction (-1
   or 1) of movement for the X servo and dY is the direction for the Y
   servo.

   NB: speed is set using writeOnControl.

/* touchHandler

   This function handles the events generated by the touchpad
   interface.

   For touchstart, we activate servo operation and tell the ESP32 to
   get ready to move. The fuzz value makes it easier for fat fingers
   to move one motor at a time. Recall, that speed is set separately
   from movement, all we need here is the direction. In touchstart we
   save the starting point so that we can get a direction from the
   very first move. We send the start command to the ESP32 using the
   controlAspect because we want to be sure it gets through.

   For touchmove, we determine the direction of movement and send it
   to the ESP32. Importantly, we only send it when it changes. This
   keeps us from flooding the BLE channel thereby increasing
   reliability.  So dX and dY are compared with lastDX and lastDY each
   time. Yes this means that we get more accurate movement when the
   user moves her finger just to get things going.  Touch, move and
   hold is the most effective way to move the servos.

   For touchend, we send "STOP" to the esp32 to stop the servos and
   deactivate servo operation with the servosActive flag.  Not sure we
   need the 50 mS delay before writing.

   NB: the servos start moving when a touchmove event is
   triggered. They keep moving until a touchend move is triggered.
   This means that a user only needs to move on the touch area to
   indicate direction -- continued movement along the same axis does
   nothing. The servos will respond if the touch reverses along an
   axis. Otherwise, touch, hold and release results in servo movement
   from the touch to the release.

   Finally, there's an interaction with these touch events and the
   default browser touch actions such as scroll and page reload. We
   try to disable the defaults within our touch area but weirdness
   remains possible.
