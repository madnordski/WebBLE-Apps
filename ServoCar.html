<!-- ServoCar
     This is used to test javascript touch elements for controlling
     motors.
     J. King 31 Oct 2024

     To run this as the front end to the ESP32 ServoCar visit:
     https://madnordski.github.io/WebBLE-Apps/ServoCar.html
     
     This project is being used to help develop the interface for a
     project that might use servos, dc motors, stepping motors or a
     combination of these.  While we await arrival of the hardware we
     need to conduct our physical experiments, we can make progress by
     tinkering with the user interface.

     WebBLE reference:
         https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/bluetooth

     We will use an ESP32-C3 to control the motors. Preliminarily an
     XIAO ESP32-C3 is being used.  The communication between the
     android interface and the ESP32-C3 will be Bluetooth Low Energy
     (BLE).  On the phone we will use WebBLE.  This file represents
     the implementation of the WebBLE interface which runs on Android
     using a Web Browser.

     NB: The WebBLE security model requires that thiis script run over
     https, which we accomplish by launching it from our GITHUB
     page. Alternatively, (according to documentation) it can be
     loaded from the phone it runs on.  However, editing and debuging
     javascript on a phone is very limited.  Using a browser on our
     desktop computer allows the use the full javascript debugger in
     Chrome.

     For the most part, we call BLE Characteristics, Aspects because it
     sounds better and is easier to type.

To connect the Android phone to Chrome running on our desktop:

1. Connect the phone to the computer over USB.

2. Under developer options on the phone enable USB debuging.

3. If USB debugging is already enabled, disable it, pause and enable
   it again before proceeding. If you don't have developer options,
   google how to enable them.

4. Now open the browser on the computer to chrome://inspect/#devices
   (it will take minutes before a connection opens that shows the web
   pages open on the phone with a link to inspect - seriously, make tea)

5. While waiting for the phone to show up, a list of targets will
   appear. Just leave it alone, eventually your phone will show up
   in this list with an inspect link for the web page you want to debug.

6. Also while waiting, on the phone load the web page you want to
   debug on your browser.  In this case, it is
   https://madnordski.github.io/WebBLE-Apps/ServoCar.html. (https is
   required, which is why we run using the github file)

7. Eventually (5-10 minutes?), a link to INSPECT the web page you're
   debugging will appear in your computer browser.  Click the inspect
   link.  You did leave this page and your phone alone this entire
   time?

8. Once this is established, try not do anything that will crash or
   close the browser because when that happens you'll need to go back
   to step 1.  WebBLE will crash the browser window if reloaded while
   connected.

9. You can now reload and debug the app running on the phone as if
   it was running in your computers browser.

     Parts of this code was based on the work of Rui Santos.

/* isWebBluetoothEnabled

  Conditions must be right for WebBLE to work. This function checks on
  most of those conditions.
  
  1. ESP32 running our BLE script ServerTest.ino.
  2. This web page loaded in a Chrome or Chromium browser.
  3. Typically, the Chrome browser will be running on an Android phone
  for convenient use. NB: a touch screen is required and the iPhone is
  not supported.
  4. The web page must be loaded over https (not just http). The
  easiest way for us regular folks to do this is by hosting it on a GIT
  hub page.  See Web Hosting options at pages.github.com.

  At the end of day, this function will tell us if all of these
  conditions are met except one.  You can load this page on a computer
  without a touch screen, the app will run but you won't be able to
  move the motors.

/* connectToDevice

   Establishing a BLE Web connection to the ESP32 is dependent on a
   number of requirements enumerated above in isWebBluetoothEnabled
   for this file.  In addition, WebBLE requires the connection to be
   initiated by a user interaction. Once triggered, the user interface
   procedure is handled by the navigator.bluetooth subsystem. The user
   selects from a list of nodes but we limit the nodes to the one
   specified in deviceName. It would be nicer if we could just
   automatically connect but I guess we would need a Java App for that
   so let's just enjoy the fact we can just hack out some javascript
   instead.

 Send commands and out-of-band control messages to the ESP32 and

 The control aspect is separate from the Servo aspect because the
 touch interface will queue up a lot of requests for movement and it
 can take time for the queue to clear. We therefore need an
 "out-of-band" method for stopping the servos.  The writeOnControl
 function used here provides this as well as other control functions
 such as disconnect by reset.

/* writeOnServo

   The servoAspect tells the ESP32 to move the motors and the
   direction of movement. We expect this function to produce failures
   because the BLE write queue is easily filled and touch events are
   quickly generated in large numbers. NB: Look carefully, you'll find
   that retries after an error are disabled. The ESP32 is more
   responsive to STOP with retries disabled and ignoring these
   failures tends to work out as the user adapts to the movement IRL.

   The format of our messages is dX<space>dY. dX is the direction (-1
   or 1) of movement for the X servo and dY is the direction for the Y
   servo.

   NB: speed is set using writeOnControl.

/* touchHandler

   This function handles the events generated by the touchpad
   interface.

   The touch area is divided into 4 quadrants. Upper right turns
   right, from center the further right turns sharper and further up
   goes faster. Upper left, the same except left.  Lower right turn
   right but in reverse and from center the further right turns
   sharper and further down goes faster. Lower left, the except
   left. The center is stopped but touching exactly in the center is
   not practical so to stop, revome the touch.

   For touchstart, we activate servo operation and tell the ESP32 to
   get ready to move. The fuzz value scales the area to 0 to 10 which
   matches the range of speed values.  Touchstart initiates movement.

   For touchmove, the touch area is used to control the speed of each
   wheel.  Moving the right wheel slower, will make the car turn
   right. The center of the touch area is slow or stopped, the edges
   are fast.  Touches to the right of center slow the wheel on the
   right and touches left slow the left wheel.  Touches above center
   move the car foreward and touches below center move it in
   reverse. Consequently, the touch area works just like a joy stick.

   It may or may not be consequential but speed changes were initially
   impelemnted as out-of-band with movement changes.  The ESP32
   probably retains that ability but this script does not use it.  All
   speed and direction changes happen here.

   For touchend, we send "STOP" to the esp32 to stop the servos and
   deactivate servo operation with the servosActive flag.

   NB: the servos start moving when a touchstart event is
   triggered. They keep moving until a touchend is triggered.  This
   means that a user only needs to touch the area to indicate
   movement.  Touch movement in the Y changes the speed and/or
   direction while touch movement in the X turns the car.

   Finally, there's an interaction with these touch events and the
   default browser touch actions such as scroll and page reload. We
   try to disable the defaults within our touch area but weirdness
   remains possible.

/* handleStatusUpdate

   Responds to changes of the ESP32 status aspect. When the ESP32
   triggers this BLE indication to give us a status update, we must
   acknowledge it. If not, the ESP32 will assume we went away and
   reboot.

   On the ESP32 side we send a status when the status changes or once
   a second if there is no change. So, yes Virgina, we did overload
   the status aspect by also making it a heartbeat (or ping pong)
   proof of life.
